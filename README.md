# xrayscanner
Code for an xray scanner in order to march through different voxels of an imaging volume. Currently, a MATLAB version of the code is working. Work in progress to port this code from Matlab to Python has been performed. Additionally, a branch is in progress of trying to use cython to increase the speed of the code.
